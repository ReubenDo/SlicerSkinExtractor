# Skin surface extraction

This repository contains the code for a Slicer module that can be used to automatically extract the skin surface on different brain imaging modalities (CT, MR) and different sequences (T1, T2, FLAIR, etc).

This is a project for the [36th NA-MIC Project Week](https://projectweek.na-mic.org/PW36_2022_Virtual/Projects/SkinSegmentation/).
